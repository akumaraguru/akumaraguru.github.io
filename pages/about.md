Hi there! I am a PhD student at the University of Southern California, working under Gaurav Sukhatme in the [Robotics Embedded Systems Laboratory](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl). I've gotten my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

Currently I work on research in adaptive sampling and motion planning with applications in aquatic robotics. Our lab group collaborates with [David Caron's lab](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/caron/) in monitoring harmful algae blooms in lakes and reservoirs in California.

Previously I've worked as a software engineer at [Meraki](https://meraki.cisco.com), and as the 2017 engineering director at [Pioneers in Engineering](https://pioneers.berkeley.edu).
