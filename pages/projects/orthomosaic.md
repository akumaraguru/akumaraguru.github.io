Collecting detailed imagery of a survey area often involves flying an aerial vehicle to take multiple top-down pictures and stitch them together in a process called orthomosaicing. This process has been well studied, but requires distinct, static features in the raw imagery to localize the each image with respect to its neighbors. However, it is infeasible to use such features when imaging bodies of water, which is oftentimes dynamic and feature-sparse. The [RESL aquatics group](https://robotics.usc.edu/resl/research/1) is working on a new method for orthomosaicing over dynamic landscapes by dropping floating, instrumented ground control points (GCPs) across the target area before the aerial survey.
