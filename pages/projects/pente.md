This was the final project by me, Douglas Hutchings, Shivani Sharma, and Scout Heid in the Fall 2015 Introduction to Robotics course at UC Berkeley. The primary aim was to demonstrate our understanding of core concepts in robotics, such as kinematics, motion planning, and perception. We built a system that allows a human to play [Pente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pente) against a [Rethink Robotics Baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_(robot)) equipped with a suction-cup gripper.
