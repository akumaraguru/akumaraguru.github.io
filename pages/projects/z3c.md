Meraki is a cloud networking company that develops routers, switches, APs and other devices that are designed to interface over a [cloud management system](https://meraki.cisco.com/form/demo).

My work at Meraki culminated in the platform bringup project for a new router with built-in LTE and WiFi capabilities, aimed as a teleworker gateway. I took existing hardware designs and a basic software stack provided by the joint design manufacturer (JDM) and set up the system to use Meraki's OS, while validating its featureset.

The bringup work involved collaboration with not only several of the engineering, product management, and hardware teams at Meraki, but also with our cellular modem vendors, and JDM engineers as well. It was a truly eye-opening experience to see just how much talent and effort goes into launching a single product at a worldwide scale.
