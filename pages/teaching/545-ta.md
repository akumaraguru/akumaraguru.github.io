In Fall of 2019, I helped revamp the introduction to robotics class for masters students under Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis. The TA team spent 5 months prior to the start of the class to rebuild the course materials with an emphasis on state estimation, kinematics, and motion planning. The homeworks were designed to build intuition through development of simple, yet fundemental algorithms in robotics, such as the the EKF, RRT, and Particle Filter. The labs were centered around using Kinoca Jaco2 arms, with the [Aikido motion planning library](https://github.com/personalrobotics/aikido) developed by the Personal Robotics Lab.
